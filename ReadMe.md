## Social media with a point.

We've all ended up mindlessly scrolling through social media at one point and wondered "how did I just spend 2 hours doom scrolling?".
Well the answer here is simple, this is the way social media was designed. Whether that's Instagram, Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn 
the point is to keep you scrolling to generate ad revenue. Eventer seeks to fix that problem.

This is a social media platform and tool to organize events while staying connected and on topic. The first screen you see when you open your
app (after logging in) is the calendar. From there, you will be able to access all different feeds that you can share with your 
friends and talk about what's happening in one area, rather than crowding group chats with double texts or off topic conversations.

This is Eventer. Social Media with a purpose.
